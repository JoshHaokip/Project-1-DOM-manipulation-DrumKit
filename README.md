# :fire: Project Overview

## Brief

> Build a Drum Kit App that uses the keyboard to mirror sounds from a drum kit. 

My goal is to display my knowledge of JaveScript and DOM manipulation by creating an app that mimics sounds of a drum kit. By creating this project, I have been able to work on event listners and using audio files in JS.
